# Musings with an emotional charge
Thu Mar 26, 2020

### Why?

Some of the best pieces of writing I have seen have come from people who are passionate about the subject. People who are emotionally charged and motivated on a lethal scale. Unfortunately, for me, that does not come easily. I cannot be passionate and motivated about the same topic over and over again.

So, where does this happen? In the chat applications. In public forums on different topics.

### What?

What you are going to see next are my collections emotionally charged banter that have come out of me. Not becuase I carefully thought about my argument. But I just focused on the keys and keyboard in front of me. Something of an unfiltered memo of my pieces of mind that I have given to people.

The essays are copy pasted vertbatim except for spelling mistakes that happend in the actual event. Things in _italics_ are the resopnses of the people who was at the victim end of my banter. I think they are sometimes important for clearing the context of what I typed next.

Enjoy.
