# Technical Musings

I spend anywhere between 12-18 hours in a day on my laptops combined. Here are my devices list

1. *[Personal Machine]* ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 1 - i7-8750H, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB NvMe SSD.
2. *[Office Laptop, refurbished]* HP Elitebook - i7-7600 (or something), 16GB DDR3, 512GB SSD, touchscreen with gyrometric sensor
3. *[Hobby]* Raspberry Pi - Model 4B+, 4GB RAM
4. *[Monitor]* LG-24MP88HV-S, IPS Panel, 1920x1080, anti-glare, 16:9

Given the devices at my disposal and my eternal love for tinkering, I keep doing stuff that is worth writing about (or so people tell me).

*Background*: I like dumb software that I can control and it does exactly what it's told to. I don't like AI-enabled smart software. They provide no benefit to anyone except the companies making them. Just let me control it.

Here is my technical memory dump of my adventures:
